## Project Summary

In this project we investigate the No-show appointment data, downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments). It collects 100k Medical Appointments from Brazil, answering the main question on whether a patient will show up or not for their scheduled appointment.  We investigate different reasons to doscover which affect whether a patient will sure up by answering the following questions:

1. Which gender is likely to show up for an appointment?
2. Does the a disease influence whether a patient will show up or not, for their appointment?
3. Does sponsering a patient influence them to show up for an appointment?
4. Does reminding a patient about their appointment through sms, influence them showing up for an appointment?
5. Does alcoholism influence a patient showing up for an appointment?
6. Which of the factors are important in predicting whether a patient will show up for their appointment?


We found out that there is no significant relationship between the different features and the no_show feature, when using correlation.We determine that the data has more females than males, and 68\% of the patients do not recieve sms, and that 20% of the patients do not show up for their medical appointment.

In regards to individual features, to answer the questions we have posed, we found out that alcoholism, gender does not have any different effect on whether one will sure up or not.Interestingly, we found out that people without schorlaship are likely to show-up comapared to those that have the schorlaship. Furthermore, people who did not recieve the schorlaship are likely to show up than those that did not show up.
