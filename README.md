## Introduction

In this project we invetsigate the No-show appointment data, downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments). It collects 100k Medical Appointments from Brazil, answering the main question on whether a patient will show up or not for their scheduled appointment.  We investigate different reasons to doscover which affect whether a patient will sure up by answering the following questions:

1. Which gender is likely to show up for an appointment?
2. Does the a disease influence whether a patient will show up or not, for their appointment?
3. Does sponsering a patient influence them to show up for an appointment?
4. Does reminding a patient about their appointment through sms, influence them showing up for an appointment?
5. Does alcoholism influence a patient showing up for an appointment?
6. Which of the factors are important in predicting whether a patient will show up for their appointment?
